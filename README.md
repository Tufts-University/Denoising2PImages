# Denoising Cervical-Tissue, Two-Photon Images

## Repository Summary
The following code can be used to implement competing models of denoising on 2D images. These particular algorithms were designed for use on two-photon images acquired by a Leica SP8 microscope. Included functions allow for customization of loss functions, trianing, and eval only. All implementation for both the RCAN [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01155-x) and CARE [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0216-7) algorithms was done in TensorFlow. Work is currently being done to improve model performance and include novel algorithms such as SRGAN [[3]](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1609.04802) which have shown high levels of performance in other studies. For more details on RCAN, CARE, or SRGAN please review the cited papers below. We would like to thank the authors of these papers for inspiring our work and providing codes to implement these models online.

## Dependencies Installation
### (Option 1) Install dependencies in base environment

1. Download the [`pip_requirements.txt`](pip_requirements.txt) from the repository
2. In your command prompt run:

    ```posh
    pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
    ```
3. Download the [`conda_requirements.txt`](conda_requirements.txt) from the repository
4. In your command prompt run:

    ```posh
    conda install --file conda_requirements.txt
    ```
### (Option 2) Create a new virtual environment

1. Download the [`pip_requirements.txt`](pip_requirements.txt) from the repository
2. Download the [`conda_requirements.txt`](conda_requirements.txt) from the repository
3. Open command prompt and change folder to where you put the `pip_requirements.txt` and `conda_requirements.txt`
4. Create a new virtual environment:

    ```posh
    python -m venv Denoising
5. Activate the virtual environment

    On Windows:

    ```posh
    .\Denoising\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source Denoising/bin/activate
    ```

6. You should see (Denoising) in the command line.

7. In your command prompt run:

    ```posh
    pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
    ```
    ```posh
    conda install --file conda_requirements.txt
    ```
   ```
